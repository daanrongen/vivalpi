# VivalPi â€” Generative Music Composition through Live Meteorological Data Sonification
Three centuries ago, Italian baroque composer Antonio Vivaldi wrote one of the most popular compositions of classical music: *Le Quattro Stagioni* ("The Four Seasons"). The representation of seasonal patterns in music brought along a revolution in musical conception. Vivaldi's arrangement consisted of a total of four concertos, each named after the season it expressed. *La Primavera* ("Spring") represents flowing creeks and the chirping of birds, *L'estate* ("Summer") expresses the merciless heat of the sun, *L'autunno* ("Autumn") celebrates the rich harvests and mild air, finishing the concerto with the icy snow of *L'inverno* ("Winter"). On the three-hundredth anniversary of Vivaldi's masterpiece, this project asks the listener to interact with their understanding of seasonal changes in a more personal way, and to engage with a tangible representation of our changing climate. A musical composition will be generated and broadcast live from a Raspberry Pi, using real-time meteorological data as harmonic variables.

The Maximilian library, as well as the coding environment Sonic Pi, allows for the computation of code-written compositions where these weather variables can be used. The program accesses weather data through API's such as OpenWeatherMap, and applies these metrics to the generated composition. The audio-synthesis can either be played on the device by using the built-in 3.5mm audio-jack, or transmitted through a server to the web. The latter would complicate the project but allow for world-wide access, as well as offer interesting possibilities such as using the browser as a medium for a visual representation of the composition. This project utilises contemporary technologies such as sonification, real-world quantification through sensors, datasets, computation, and the web. The music will show significant differences in its composition between summer and winter, and between a rainy day and a sunny day, allowing listeners to perceive weather in an audible format. VivalPi pays a tribute to the virtuoso and aims to put his works in a contemporary context by using data and computation.
